# DataCrawler_XR

**DataCrawler_XR** is a high-performance, concurrent web crawler designed to scrape, process, and analyze data at scale. The project leverages modern networking and concurrency techniques to efficiently collect and manage data from various websites. It supports distributed crawling, asynchronous I/O, and advanced data extraction with the goal of gathering valuable insights from web content.

## Main Features

- **Concurrent Crawling**: Efficiently scrape multiple pages simultaneously using asynchronous I/O and multi-threading.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scalable design to distribute the crawling process across multiple machines using message queues.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract and process useful data from webpages, with potential integration for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
- **Anti-Bot Handling**: Implement mechanisms to bypass common bot detection strategies (e.g., CAPTCHA) using browser automation.
- **Extensible and Configurable**: Easily add custom scraping rules or modify crawler behavior via configuration files.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core language for implementing the crawler.
- **Boost.Asio**: For asynchronous I/O operations.
- **CMake**: Build system to configure and compile the project.
- **Threading and Concurrency**: Multi-threading for concurrent requests and data processing.
- **Message Queues (Optional)**: For distributed crawling (using technologies like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ).
- **Selenium**: (Optional) For bypassing bot detection with automated browser control.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **C++17 or higher** compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- **CMake** (version 3.10+)
- **Boost Libraries** (for threading and Asio)
- **Selenium** (Optional) for advanced anti-bot handling
